# SlowApi

A rate limiting library for Starlette and FastAPI adapted from [flask-limiter](http://github.com/alisaifee/flask-limiter).

Note: this is alpha quality code still, the API may change, and things may fall apart while you try it.

The documentation is on [read the docs](https://slowapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Quick start

## Installation

`slowapi` is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/slowapi/) so you can install it as usual:

```
$ pip install slowapi
```

# Features

Most feature are coming from (will come from) FlaskLimiter and the underlying [limits](https://limits.readthedocs.io/).

Supported now:

- Single and multiple `limit` decorator on endpoint functions to apply limits
- redis, memcached and memory backends to track your limits (memory as a fallback)
- support for sync and async HTTP endpoints
- Support for shared limits across a set of routes


# Limitations and known issues

  * The `request` argument must be explicitly passed to your endpoint, or `slowapi` won't be able to hook into it. In other words, write:

```python
    @limiter.limit("5/minute")
    async def myendpoint(request: Request)
        pass
```

and not:

```python
    @limiter.limit("5/minute")
    async def myendpoint()
        pass
```

  * `websocket` endpoints are not supported yet.

# Developing and contributing

PRs are more than welcome! Please include tests for your changes :)

The package uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage dependencies. To setup your dev env:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

To run the tests:
```bash
$ pytest
```

# Credits

Credits go to [flask-limiter](https://github.com/alisaifee/flask-limiter) of which SlowApi is a (still partial) adaptation to Starlette and FastAPI.
It's also important to mention that the actual rate limiting work is done by [limits](https://github.com/alisaifee/limits/), `slowapi` is just a wrapper around it.
